# Landing Page - The Odin Project

This project is a solution to the "Landing Page" assignment from the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

## 🎯 Project Goals

The main focus of this project was to implement a fixed-width layout using **CSS Flexbox**, following the specific design guidelines provided by the course. Per the project requirements, the focus was on layout structure and element alignment rather than responsiveness.

### Key Learnings
* **Flexbox Fundamentals:** Mastering `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` to align headers, hero sections, and footers.
* **The "Container" Pattern:** Using a central wrapper with `max-width: 1200px` to keep content organized while allowing backgrounds to span the full viewport.
* **Visual Consistency:** Implementing `object-fit: cover` on images to ensure uniform sizes across gallery sections.
* **Semantic HTML:** Building a clean document structure using `header`, `main`, `section`, and `footer` tags.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5** - Semantic structure.
* **CSS3** - Flexbox and custom styling.
* **WSL (Ubuntu 24.04)** - Development environment.
* **VS Code** - Primary editor.

## 📌 Note
Following the curriculum of The Odin Project, this site is optimized for desktop viewing to solidify core CSS layout concepts before moving into responsive design in later modules.
